Metadata,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inpatient and Day Case Activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Source of data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hospital Inpatient System and KH03a Departmental Return.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data series,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
From Financial Year 2006/07.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Available/Occupied Beds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The number of available and occupied beds during the year in wards that are open overnight, measured at midnight. Hospitals may also have a number of beds in wards that are only open during the day. Beds reserved for day care admission or regular day admission are not included.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inpatients,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Inpatient admissions include both (a) patients admitted electively with the expectation that they will remain in hospital for at least one night, and (b) non-elective admissions (e.g. emergency admissions). A patient who is admitted with this intention but who leaves hospital for any reason without staying overnight is still counted as an inpatient. Day cases and regular attenders are not included.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Day Case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A patient admitted electively during the course of a day with the intention of receiving care who does not require the use of a hospital bed overnight and who returns home as scheduled. If this original intention is not fulfilled and the patient stays overnight, such a patient should be counted as an inpatient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Admissions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Total admissions has been taken to be the sum of all day cases, inpatients (elective and non elective) and regular attenders. Deaths and discharges have been used as an approximation of admissions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FCE - Finished Consultant Episode,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A consultant episode is the time a patient spends in the continuous care of one consultant. The episode can be finished because of discharge, death or transfer, either to another consultant or another hospital. As a result, a patient may have more than one FCE during a stay in hospital (if transferred to the care of another consultant).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Specialty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A specialty is a particular branch of medicine or surgery. Each consultant is assigned a main specialty from a list recognised by the Royal Colleges and Faculties. Information is recorded against the specialty of the treating consultant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Explanatory Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Source: The data contained in this publication have been compiled from the quarterly Krner Aggregate Returns (KARs), which were introduced from 01 April 1988 and the Hospital Inpatient System. They refer to all general, mental illness and learning disability hospitals. Any amendments notified by Providers after 9th August 2010 have not been included.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Programmes of Care (POCs): This bulletin has been structured on a POC basis. This should facilitate analysis by individuals with an interest in specific POCs. However, an overall NI summary section has also been included for those with a more generalist perspective.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Activity has been grouped into POCs on the basis of the main specialty of the consultant in charge of the patient. In a small number of cases, this may lead to differences between the strict POC and the specialty of the consultant in charge. An example of this would be patients in a hospital ward reserved exclusively for the younger physically disabled who would be included in the Acute Services POC when applying the specialty rule rather than the correct POC of Physical and Sensory Disability. However, the specialty rule will apportion activity to the correct POC in the vast majority of cases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A significant number of tables in the NI Summary section are not replicated for individual POC sections, either because the Korner return on which the table was based did not have a specialty breakdown or because the activity contained in the table is not relevant to that particular POC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Admissions/Discharges and Deaths: Information on Admissions has been taken from the Hospital Inpatient System for POC 1 and the KH03a for all other POCs. This is because information held on the Hospital Inpatient System for non-acute specialties is not fully comprehensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hospitals/Providers: In accordance with the Review of Public Administration, with effect from the 01 April 2007, five new integrated Health and Social Care Trusts (Belfast, Northern, South Eastern, Southern and Western) replaced the previous eighteen provider Trusts in Northern Ireland.  Tables have been presented based on the new Trust Areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
