## Intro to the method of reporting

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## DQR Continuous Data

From the code provided in the slides, we can rebuild our table. Either copy and paste all the code into a code block like the ones above, or just reference the .R file, like this (make sure you comment out anything you don't want to run). Note that I have set *eval=FALSE* that's because I don't want it to run -- it will make a mess of the document.

```{r eval=FALSE}
source("1-cleaned.R")
```

So let's rebuild the table:
```{r echo=FALSE}
churn <- read.csv(file="./datasets/ABT_Telco_Churn.csv", 
                  na.strings = c("", "#N/A"))

churn$Churn_Fl <- factor(churn$Churn_Fl, labels=c("N", "Y"), levels=c(0,1))

# Remove what we don't need
churn$Cust_No <- NULL
churn$Tarriff_Type <- NULL

## Example DQR I
n <- sapply(churn, function(x) {is.numeric(x)})
churn_numerics <- churn[, n]
instances <- sapply(churn_numerics, FUN=function(x) {length(x)})
missing <- sapply(churn_numerics, FUN=function(x) {sum(is.na(x))})
missing <- missing / instances * 100
unique <- sapply(churn_numerics, FUN=function(x) {length(unique(x))})
quantiles <- t(sapply(churn_numerics, FUN=function(x) {quantile(x)}))
means <- sapply(churn_numerics, FUN=function(x) {mean(x)})
sds <- sapply(churn_numerics, FUN=function(x) {sd(x)})

## Example DQR II
df_numeric <- data.frame(Feature=names(churn_numerics), 
                         Instances=instances,
                         Missing=missing,
                         Cardinality=unique,
                         Min=quantiles[,1],
                         FirstQuantile=quantiles[,2],
                         Median=quantiles[,3],
                         ThirdQuantile=quantiles[,4],
                         Max=quantiles[,5],
                         Mean=means,
                         Stdev=sds)

rownames(df_numeric) <- NULL

## Example DQR III
library(knitr)
df_numeric$Feature <- c("Contract Len", "Avg Bill", "Avg OOB TC", "Avg OOB TA", "Avg Voice", "Avg SMS", "Avg Data", "Age")

# I'm using some formatting tricks here for the presentation
kable(df_numeric, caption = "Continuous Data Quality Report", digits = 2)
```

Oops, our table is too wide! Either we would need to break it down a little like this:
```{r}
kable(df_numeric[, c(1:4)], caption = "Continuous Data Quality Report", digits = 2)
kable(df_numeric[, c(1,5:8)], caption = "Continuous Data Quality Report", digits = 2)
```

Or display it in landscape:
```{r}
library(kableExtra)
landscape(knitr::kable(df_numeric, caption = "Continuous Data Quality Report", digits = 2))
```
